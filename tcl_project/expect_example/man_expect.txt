       log_file [args] [[-a] file]
             If a filename is provided, log_file will record a transcript of the session (beginning at that point) in the file.  log_file will stop recording if no argument  is  given.
             Any previous log file is closed.

             Instead of a filename, a Tcl file identifier may be provided by using the -open or -leaveopen flags.  This is similar to the spawn command.  (See spawn for more info.)

             The -a flag forces output to be logged that was suppressed by the log_user command.

             By  default, the log_file command appends to old files rather than truncating them, for the convenience of being able to turn logging off and on multiple times in one ses‚Äê
             sion.  To truncate files, use the -noappend flag.

             The -info flag causes log_file to return a description of the most recent non-info arguments given.
